# Professional website

## Description
The purpose of this project is to create an example of a professional website. I have decided to create an example of an editors/writers website.
I intend to use Python in the backend and JavaScript/React in the frontend.

## Requirements
As this is a web application, the user will not be required to download any specific software etc. However, I intend to add a feature where a user can only access a part of the webiste if they have the correct password

## What the program does
A mock-up of a professional editor/writers professional website.

## Edge cases
